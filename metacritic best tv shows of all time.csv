7,The Office (UK): Season 1,"July 9, 2001","""Trust, encouragement, reward, loyalty... satisfaction. That's what I'm..you know. Trust people and they'll be true to you. Treat them greatly, and they will show themselves to be great."" - David Brent. The Office tells a story of a few people working in a British office working hard to not lose their jobs. This hilarious comedy won a Golden Globe award for best comedy series. It was created by Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant. David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is a manager of low intelligence and has no sense of humor, but is convinced that he is the best, the most entertaining and the most well liked boss of all time.Today the show has been sold in more than 60 countries and it even had a remake in America. The Office is the first non-American show nominated in the category of best television musical or comedy for a Golden Globe Award; and Ricky Gervais was the first non-American actor nominated for the lead role in a television comedy for the same award. The Office won both awards and left Sex and the City & Matt LeBlanc empty handed. When the series aired the first season, they did not even know how popular it would get in some future episodes. The fact that its release on the DVD format proved to be the BBC's best selling comedy release shows its mass popularity and appeal.The writers at the start did not imagine that a second season would be created and after bowing to pressure to create one they would not do it again for a third. The show ended on a high note after two Christmas specials which tied up knots and rounded off wonderfully the first two seasons.Opening Theme Song: ""Handbags and Gladrags"" performed by Fin.WARNING: some episodes contain quotes with strong language.",98,8.5,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/5/8a3b3b532241017bb81a276f721bdbd8-98.jpg

10,The Wire: Season 3,"September 19, 2004","In chronicling a multi-generational family business dealing illegal drugs and the efforts of the Baltimore police to curb their trade, this series draws parallels between these organizations and the men and women on either side of the battle.The words of Gary W. Potter, Professor of Criminal Justice and Police Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, in writing about the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, can also be used to illuminate some of the central premises of the show:""There is precious little difference between those people who society designates as respectable and law abiding and those people society castigates as hoodlums and thugs. The world of corporate finance and corporate capital is as criminogenic and probably more criminogenic than any poverty-wracked slum neighborhood. The distinctions drawn between business, politics, and organized crime are at best artificial and in reality irrelevant. Rather than being dysfunctions, corporate crime, white-collar crime, organized crime, and political corruption are mainstays of American political-economic life.""Tim Goodman, the television critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, summed the show up perfectly when he wrote: ""This show is precisely the reason you pay for HBO.""In New York's Newsday, Diane Werts says: ""Most TV crime series aspire to John Grisham's level. 'The Wire' aspires to Dostoevsky's.""Season ThemesSeason One centers around a family of drug dealers and the innerworkings of their empire.  It also follows the detectives who are trying to catch the high members of the empire.  Season Two steps away from the drug trade (while still mentioning characters from the previous season) to a case of dead prostitutes which turns into a look at the corruption surrounding the Port.  Season Three investigates politics and finishes the main stories that were left open in season one.  Season Four focuses on four middle school students and their journeys through the public school system and continues to address the politics of an inner-city and the issues of an election.  Season Five is rumored to be about the media's role in Baltimore.  Season Five will be the show's final season.Theme MusicIn the Season One opening credits, the Blind Boys of Alabama did Tom Waits's ""Way Down in the Hole"". The Season Two opening credits feature Waits's version of the song. According to creator David Simon, ""It was our way of saying: This is the same show (song) but this year, the tale itself (singer, tonality) will be different."" The Neville Brothers's version of the song opens Season Three. The theme which plays over the end credits was composed by the show's music supervisor, Blake Leyh.

33,Homicide: Life on the Street: Season 1,"January 31, 1993","This series was the most reality-based police drama that has ever aired on television.  It was shot entirely with handheld cameras on location in the Fells Point Community of Baltimore, MD.  One of the series' executive producers, Barry Levinson, is a Baltimore native.  He has written and directed at least three films that take place in Baltimore: ""Diner"", ""Tin Men"" & ""Avalon"".  Doing this show was a natural for him.

The series was based on a book called ""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets,"" by David Simon, a writer who spent a year with the members of Baltimore's homicide unit.  Some of the series' characters and cases were based on the book.

This series was unlike most cop shows of that time, in that there were almost no car chases, gunfights and etc.  This show was about closing cases and the act of the crime was usually never seen.  Generally, the viewer first sees the case when the detective(s) arrive on the scene.  Open cases are kept track of on a board, open cases under the primary detective's name are shown in red ink, when the case is closed the red is replaced by black ink.  During the first season it aired, it didn't have great ratings and the chances for a second season looked bleak.  When Steven Bochco's NYPD Blue premiered in the Fall of '93 and got great ratings, police dramas ""were in"" and the series was given the go-ahead for a second season (the two Emmy Awards probably didn't hurt either).  The better ratings of the second season led to a full third and subsequent seasons.  When the Lifetime cable channel picked the show up for syndication in 1997 it helped guarantee that there would be a fifth season.  Then NBC made it possible for the series to have a sixth and seventh season.

With the great cast, acting, writing, and directing the series has won awards including a few Emmy Awards, Writer's Guild Awards and George Foster Peabody Awards.  Most of these awards were earned by Tom Fontana, one of the series' executive producers, whose other credits include St. Elsewhere.  In the 1995-1996 television season Andre Braugher was finally nominated for Best Actor in a Drama.  While he didn't win that year, two years later in the 1997-1998 television season he was again nominated, this time the Television Academy recognized what we already knew, that Andre Braugher was the best actor working in television drama.

One of the highlights of the series, starting with the second season was the use of music.  All varieties of music have been featured throughout the series, most often it was featured in a montage of the detectives conducting their investigation.

41,The Office (UK): Season 2,"September 30, 2002","""Trust, encouragement, reward, loyalty... satisfaction. That's what I'm..you know. Trust people and they'll be true to you. Treat them greatly, and they will show themselves to be great."" - David Brent. The Office tells a story of a few people working in a British office working hard to not lose their jobs. This hilarious comedy won a Golden Globe award for best comedy series. It was created by Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant. David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is a manager of low intelligence and has no sense of humor, but is convinced that he is the best, the most entertaining and the most well liked boss of all time.Today the show has been sold in more than 60 countries and it even had a remake in America. The Office is the first non-American show nominated in the category of best television musical or comedy for a Golden Globe Award; and Ricky Gervais was the first non-American actor nominated for the lead role in a television comedy for the same award. The Office won both awards and left Sex and the City & Matt LeBlanc empty handed. When the series aired the first season, they did not even know how popular it would get in some future episodes. The fact that its release on the DVD format proved to be the BBC's best selling comedy release shows its mass popularity and appeal.The writers at the start did not imagine that a second season would be created and after bowing to pressure to create one they would not do it again for a third. The show ended on a high note after two Christmas specials which tied up knots and rounded off wonderfully the first two seasons.Opening Theme Song: ""Handbags and Gladrags"" performed by Fin.WARNING: some episodes contain quotes with strong language.",93,8.9,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-2,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/5/8a3b3b532241017bb81a276f721bdbd8-98.jpg

From Executive Producer David Milch (""NYPD Blue"") comes DEADWOOD, a new drama series that focuses on the birth of an American frontier town and the ruthless power struggle that exists in its lawless boundaries. The story begins two weeks after Custer's defeat at Little Bighorn, combining fictional and real-life characters and events in an epic morality tale. Located in the Black Hills Indian Cession, the ""town"" of Deadwood is an illegal settlement, a violent and uncivilized outpost that attracts a colorful array of characters looking to get rich - from outlaws and entrepreneurs to ex-soldiers and racketeers, Chinese laborers, prostitutes, city dudes and gunfighters.",93,9.1,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/deadwood/season-2,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/8/a3fffca34845350b35eb76ec76f2c1c2-98.jpg

46,Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3,"September 15, 2002","Each half-hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features verité-style footage of David (playing himself) at home, at work and around town, as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real-life personalities. With cast regulars Jeff Garlin (as manager Jeff Greene) and Cheryl Hines (as wife Cheryl), the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles. Candid, unsparing and self-deprecating, Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off-kilter comic vision of Larry David--co-creator and co-executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history, Seinfeld--to HBO. The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction, as David (playing himself) and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private, often banal world of a (relatively) public man. Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a ""Murphy's Law"" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.
In Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry! (""Stop it, Larry!"")In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry (""Larry's Crazy Life"")In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt, Larry!In Finland it is known as JÃ¤itÃ¤ hattuun",93,8.8,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-3,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/6/f8b07f682be177c5c9d7f311a57272ef-98.jpg

124,Arrested Development: Season 1,"November 2, 2003","The Emmy Award-winning comedy series ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT revolves around MICHAEL BLUTH (Jason Bateman), the “normal” one in a family of crazies, who is forced to stay in Orange County and run the family real estate business after his father, GEORGE BLUTH SR. (Jeffrey Tambor), is sent to prison for shifty accounting practices.  While George Sr. spent the last year in the slammer discovering his newfound Judaism and recording inspirational tapes, Michael spent it picking up the pieces and trying to teach his offbeat family how to live without an endless expense account.  All the while, Michael has also been trying to do right by his 14-year-old son, GEORGE MICHAEL (Michael Cera), an earnest kid who works diligently at the family’s frozen banana stand. 

The Bluths are led by manipulative matriarch LUCILLE BLUTH (Jessica Walter), a socialite who is as icy as her martinis.  Then there’s the oldest son, GOB (Will Arnett), a womanizer and struggling magician (sorry, “illusionist”) whose biggest trick will be to make a real job appear.  The youngest brother is BUSTER (Tony Hale), a neurotic professional grad student and glorified mama’s boy (he spent 11 months in the womb). 

The Bluth siblings are rounded out by cause-obsessed sister LINDSAY (Portia de Rossi), who is married to the hapless TOBIAS (David Cross), a doctor-turned-actor who might get more work if he wasn’t a self-proclaimed “never-nude.” Lindsay and Tobias are the ultra-permissive parents of MAEBY (Alia Shawkat), a 14-year-old who loves finding unique ways to rebel against their overindulgence.",89,9.2,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/arrested-development/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/6/dc8d6d267a350d56dcf08e5e254b13ce-98.jpg

147,Freaks and Geeks: Season 1,"September 25, 1999","The universal experience of teenagehood as lived by the regular old freaks and geeks in a Michigan high school, circa 1980, is the subject of this wistful comedy-drama executive-produced by Emmy-winner Judd Apatow and series creator Paul Feig. Revolving around the lives of freak and geek siblings Lindsay and Sam Weir (Linda Cardellini, John Daley), the show includes the everyday fears, humiliations and little triumphs of adolescents past, present and, no doubt, future,too. For sophomore Lindsay, life is getting difficult. Jolted by the death of her grandmother, she dons her dad's old Army jacket and fights the one-girl battle of McKinley High. The allure of being a champion ""mathlete"" is losing its appeal, and her goals of college and career feel somehow irrelevant. She's alienated. Luckily, though, she's not really alone. Drifting away from her studious friends, she finds herself increasingly drawn to others like her, the ""freaks"" who ' refuse to accept the status quo. Among them are Daniel (James Franco), a friendly but also a  dangerous guy who seems to like Lindsay, as does his bud Nick (Jason Segel), who dreams of stardom as a rock-and-roll drummer a la Led Zeppelin's Jon Bonham. Then there's Ken (Seth Rogen), an acerbic rebel, and Kim (Busy Philipps), a tough girl who doesn't go easy on Lindsay. Meanwhile, Lindsay's freshman brother Sam navigates high school like a mouse in a maze. Threatened at every turn, and attracted to an unattainable cheerleader, Sam faces his own set of obstacles. But he has good friends. Sure, they're ""geeks,"" but so is Sam. There's Neal (Samm Levine), a wise-acre, sci-fi loving geek, and bespectacled Bill (Martin Starr), a classic looking nerd who's unfortunately not as brainy as he appears. On the homefront, Lindsay and Sam suffer through the good intentions of their overbearing mom (Becky Ann Baker) and their hardwired dad Joe Flaherty), who turns every teen issue into a matter of life and death. Unfortunately the show was canceled after only 12 episodes had aired, this was due to the poor ratings obtained.

157,Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1,"January 9, 2000","Created and executive-produced by Emmy Award-winning writer Linwood Boomer, this inventive half-hour series is seen through the eyes of MALCOLM (Frankie Muniz), a regular high school kid trying to navigate his way through life despite the various obstacles thrown in his way – a complete misunderstanding of girls, the constant burden of masterminding plans to get himself and his brothers into or out of trouble, and a miserable job at the Lucky Aide… not to mention a severe case of teen angst.

Although Malcolm has a genius IQ, he can't seem to make sense of the opposite sex, much less his embarrassing family. Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) is the outspoken, opinionated mom, who still manages to rule the roost even though her boys are growing wise to her crafty ways. Hal (Bryan Cranston), a dad who is just a bumbling, big kid at heart, often finds himself creating more chaos than his five boys combined. Reese (Justin Berfield) has mastered the art of a perfect blank stare, and makes up for his lack of intelligence with deviance.

Francis (Christopher Masterson), Malcolm's oldest and favorite brother, is willing to move from Alabama to Alaska to New Mexico – as long as its keeps him from moving back home. Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), no longer the youngest, has learned his tricks from the best and often pulls the wool right over his brothers' eyes. And then there's Jamie, the newest member … and family scapegoat.

451,Dharma & Greg: Season 1,"September 24, 1997","Dharma & Greg was an unusual cross-generational situation comedy created by Chuck Lorre & Dottie Dartland. Dharma Freedom Finkelstein-Montgomery (Jenna Elfman, ""Townies"") is a free-spirited yoga instructor with an incredible knack for looking on the bright side. Raised by hippie parents, she was taught to shun convention, trust her wildest instincts, and find the joy in everyday life. Her husband, Greg Montgomery (Thomas Gibson, ""Chicago Hope""), is a conservative, Harvard-educated attorney and the yin to Dharma's yang. Married on their first date, they have remained committed to each other from day one, despite the obstacles presented by the world around them.Among those obstacles are Dharma's counterculture parents, Abby (Mimi Kennedy) and Larry (Alan Rachins), who recently brought another bohemian bundle of joy — baby Harry — into the world. On the other side, literally, are Greg's uptight, blue-blood parents, Kitty (Susan Sullivan) and Edward (Mitchell Ryan), who've slowly but surely come to accept the fact that their son married outside the country club boundaries. Executive producer Chuck Lorre made minor television history by taking advantage of the fact that many fans didn't see the show at the time of its broadcast: for those who videotaped the show, each episode's end credits reveal a special message from Lorre on a vanity card. These are currently being added and can be found under the ""Notes"" section for each episode.

465,Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1,"October 15, 2000","Each half-hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features verité-style footage of David (playing himself) at home, at work and around town, as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real-life personalities. With cast regulars Jeff Garlin (as manager Jeff Greene) and Cheryl Hines (as wife Cheryl), the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles. Candid, unsparing and self-deprecating, Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off-kilter comic vision of Larry David--co-creator and co-executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history, Seinfeld--to HBO. The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction, as David (playing himself) and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private, often banal world of a (relatively) public man. Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a ""Murphy's Law"" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.
In Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry!

496,Frasier: Season 1,"September 16, 1993","""Frasier"" provides a weekly dose of the neuroses and tribulations suffered by an insecure and pompous psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane, host of a Seattle radio advice show at KACL. The twice-divorced doctor's peaceful home life of fine cigars and haute cuisine was shattered when his gruff, ex-cop father, Martin, was injured in the line of duty and forced to move in with Frasier. Martin brought with him a semi-psychic, live-in home-care provider, Daphne Moon, his pesky Jack Russell terrier, Eddie, and a duct-taped recliner that clashes with Frasier's more aesthetically pleasing Eames and Wassily chairs. Their home is frequently visited by Frasier's snobbish and competitive brother, Niles, a fellow psychiatrist whose longtime romantic interest in Daphne was finally happily realized at the conclusion of Season 7. At work, his slightly jaded producer and man-hungry single parent Roz Doyle, supports Frasier. Some of the people who voice the callers to Frasier's radio program are often bigtime celebrities.

""Frasier"", starring Kelsey Grammer in his Emmy Award-winning title role of Dr. Frasier Crane, made history by becoming the first series, comedy or drama, to achieve a record five consecutive Emmy wins for Outstanding Comedy Series. With this achievement, the series stands ahead of ""Cheers"", the series from which ""Frasier"" was spun-off. Overall, ""Frasier"" earned a total of 37 Emmys (more than any other series in history), including four for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Kelsey Grammer and four for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for David Hyde Pierce. It's also interesting to point out that Kelsey Grammer played the part of Frasier for 20 years, tying him for the longest duration playing the same character on television and, that the show included guest appearances from almost all regulars from ""Cheers"", excluding Kirstie Alley.

524,Seinfeld: Season 1,"July 5, 1989","This is a show about nothing; however, for a show about nothing, this show has many complex plots, sub-plots, is very well written and put together. So much so that until the public caught onto the series, the television critics were responsible for helping to keep it alive. The critics further went on and made the series victorious in every category it was eligible for in the 1st Annual American Television Awards. Seinfeld has also won a few Emmy Awards, the George Foster Peabody Award for 1992 and many more. Many of the early episodes were based on the life experiences of series co-creator, Larry David. Stories such as The Stock Tip and The Jacket really happened, as did many others. Across the hall from Larry lived a man named Kenny Kramer, who aside from the physical comedy aspects, lives the life of TV Kramer. Find out all about him at the real Kramer's web site. Some aspects were based on Jerry's life. Jerry's real address in NYC when he was struggling comic was 129 W. 81 St., this is the address used for his building in the series. In the series, Jerry lives in apartment 5A, Kramer in 5B. Viewer Jason Dean Vaupel notes that in a couple of episodes of the second season, Jerry lives in apartment 3A. And Newman's apartment has usually been 5E, but viewer Jeff Holland notes that it sometimes is 5F and that 5E was rented out to someone else as already noted in the episode, The Conversion. Their building is called The Shelley according to viewer Kipp Teague whose discerned that from the awning on the building. However, that building is actually located in Los Angeles, the building at the real address in NYC is much different. Jeff Holland also notes that The Shelley has no visible fire escapes, but there is one outside of Jerry's window. Other aspects are composite of both lives. For example, Elaine's character is half based on Jerry's ex-girlfriend Carol Leifer. Carol joined the production staff in the 5th season. An ex-girlfriend of Larry David's, named Monica Yates, whose father was a noted writer in the other half of the Elaine equation. Larry David once wore a suede jacket that got wet while meeting her father. Another viewer, Bobby Bank, notes that a tribute to Jerry's father is seen in occasional episodes. Jerry's father, named Kal, worked in the sign business, so occasionally in the background you may see a sign that says Kal's Signs. Bobby stated in a trade magazine for the sign industry called Signs of the Times that he... Quote:
had the pleasure of meeting and working with Kal in the early 70s when we were producing Jewelite (Bobby's company) letters for him. I remember Kal saying, 'Bobby, you should meet my son Jerry. He's a real funny guy.'

Viewer Robert Buchanan also reminds me that it is ironic that Jerry's father's name is Kal, and Superman's real Kryptonian name is Kal-El.

Most every episode takes place in Jerry's apartment; however, there are (of course) a few exceptions: The Chinese Restaurant, The Pen, The Parking Garage, The Subway, The Limo, The Airport, The Movie, The Hamptons, The Merv Griffin Show & The Dealership. While no activity occurs there, an empty apartment is shown in The Puerto Rican Day.

541,The Wire: Season 1,"June 2, 2002","In chronicling a multi-generational family business dealing illegal drugs and the efforts of the Baltimore police to curb their trade, this series draws parallels between these organizations and the men and women on either side of the battle.The words of Gary W. Potter, Professor of Criminal Justice and Police Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, in writing about the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, can also be used to illuminate some of the central premises of the show:""There is precious little difference between those people who society designates as respectable and law abiding and those people society castigates as hoodlums and thugs. The world of corporate finance and corporate capital is as criminogenic and probably more criminogenic than any poverty-wracked slum neighborhood. The distinctions drawn between business, politics, and organized crime are at best artificial and in reality irrelevant. Rather than being dysfunctions, corporate crime, white-collar crime, organized crime, and political corruption are mainstays of American political-economic life.""Tim Goodman, the television critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, summed the show up perfectly when he wrote: ""This show is precisely the reason you pay for HBO.""In New York's Newsday, Diane Werts says: ""Most TV crime series aspire to John Grisham's level. 'The Wire' aspires to Dostoevsky's.""Season ThemesSeason One centers around a family of drug dealers and the innerworkings of their empire.  It also follows the detectives who are trying to catch the high members of the empire.  Season Two steps away from the drug trade (while still mentioning characters from the previous season) to a case of dead prostitutes which turns into a look at the corruption surrounding the Port.  Season Three investigates politics and finishes the main stories that were left open in season one.  Season Four focuses on four middle school students and their journeys through the public school system and continues to address the politics of an inner-city and the issues of an election.  Season Five is rumored to be about the media's role in Baltimore.  Season Five will be the show's final season.Theme MusicIn the Season One opening credits, the Blind Boys of Alabama did Tom Waits's ""Way Down in the Hole"". The Season Two opening credits feature Waits's version of the song. According to creator David Simon, ""It was our way of saying: This is the same show (song) but this year, the tale itself (singer, tonality) will be different."" The Neville Brothers's version of the song opens Season Three. The theme which plays over the end credits was composed by the show's music supervisor, Blake Leyh.

574,Joan of Arcadia: Season 1,"September 26, 2003","Joan of Arcadia is a drama that follows a typical family facing atypical situations, not the least of which is their teenage daughter's conversations with God. A tough but soft-hearted police detective in Arcadia, Will Girardi (Joe Mantegna) dreams of providing a safe haven for his family and community. An outbreak of serious crime in his idyllic new town has challenged Girardi's desire for order, as have the ups and downs he faces with his family. Daughter Joan (Amber Tamblyn), an average teenager, has been acting a little strange. Most don't know that it has to do with the unusual way various people keep popping up, introducing themselves as God and then giving her specific directions to do things, such as get a job, join the debate team or volunteer with children. The appearances are hard for her to believe, even more so as she never knows who's going to turn up next. One minute it's a cute boy her own age, the next it's the lunch lady or a little girl. She'd been keeping it a secret from everyone, though she has finally revealed it to her artistic and generally sensitive boyfriend, Adam (Christopher Marquette), who believes she's been experiencing hallucinations.

Rounding out the Girardi family are her art-teacher mother, Helen (Mary Steenburgen); her 16-year-old science-geek brother, Luke (Michael Welch), and her older, newspaper-writer brother, Kevin (Jason Ritter), a former high-school sports star who is in a wheelchair as a result of a car accident. Joan's unlikely new best friend is her publicly caustic and rebellious, but privately insightful and supportive classmate, Grace (Becky Wahlstrom). Unsure of what God wants--if God exists--and if she's even sane, Joan tentatively follows God's cryptic directives, all the while trying to retain a normal teenaged existence. Theme Song:

702,The Real World: Season 2,"June 26, 1993","""This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped. Find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. The Real World...""

How many times have we heard those words? The Real World was the first reality show on tv, premiering in 1992. It is still on the air, about to air it's 21st season, set in Brooklyn. When The Real World was created, it created a new genre of television that years later would be copied by other networks and become almost an obsession around the world. MTV originally wanted to make a soap opera, but the costs were too high, so they thought ""what if we could get rid of writers, and scripts, and sets?"". That resulted on the first Real World, set in NY neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, where 7 people that had never met before had to live in a house together for some time.

As the years went by, The Real World slowly gained its shape and space. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, Paris, San Diego, Philadelphia, Austin, Key West, Denver, Sydney and now Hollywood...all these locations have hosted the show. Auditions to be a cast member today attract hundreds of thousands of people in hopes to be one of the strangers in the house. Living rent-free for 6 months in a very hip house with very interesting (and often annoying) roommates, and being on an internationally broadcast tv show is quite attractive to people in their late teens/early 20s.

How much of the show is actually true we'll never know. A lot of what we see on tv is edited to make it look like it all happened in a certain timeline. All the houses have cameras everywhere, and there's a clause in the contract of each housemate that says they're not allowed to go places where the cameras are not allowed in. And all the sounds are taped in a separate way, so, according to Melissa from New Orleans, a lot of times when they're talking and you can only see the back of their heads, the words you hear might not be the words they actually said at the time. Edited or not, none of the scenes aired on the show are acted. They all happened, without scripts.

Each cast member receives around $250 per week, plus their house expenses paid (not including food. That's why every time a parent comes over, they cook). Anything else they want, they have to pay for. Plus, they don't get to take any of all the cool stuff you see in the house.

Today, The Real World is shown in several countries, and local versions of the show have already been made. Loving it or hating it, you just know it's here. The Real World: the first and original reality show.",77,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-real-world/season-2,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/3/24d51f9f169c10e36fe775284dfde6a3-98.jpg

825,Without a Trace: Season 1,"September 26, 2002","Without a Trace is a fast-paced procedural drama about the Missing Persons Squad of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The sole responsibility of the special task force is to find missing persons by applying advanced psychological profiling techniques to peel back the layers of the victims' lives and trace their whereabouts in an effort to discover whether they have been abducted, been murdered, committed suicide or simply run away. The team reconstructs a ""Day of Disappearance"" timeline that details every minute of the 24 hours prior to the disappearance, following one simple rule: learn who the victim is in order to learn where the victim is. Senior agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) heads the dedicated team that knows too well that every second counts when someone vanishes. His squad includes Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery), an agent who doesn't let her good looks get in the way of being tough; Vivian Johnson (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a no-nonsense investigator; Danny Taylor (Enrique Murciano), an intense and private agent; and Martin Fitzgerald (Eric Close), the newest member of the team, considered a lightweight by the squad because his only experience involves fighting white-collar crime.

In six seasons, much has happened. Martin Fitzgerald is no longer considered the lightweight he once was, having earned the respect of the team through his solid work. Jack Malone has been through many ups and downs and now finds himself in a bad position following the mishandling of a case. Vivian Johnson has proven herself, and a new agent has been welcomed into the ranks -- Elena Delgado (Roselyn Sánchez), a Hispanic female agent who came on in the program's fourth season as the squad faced ever-increasing demands on its time and resources. A former member of the NYPD, she is already known to Danny and their connection grows as the series progresses.

Without a Trace aired Thursday nights on CBS from its premiere in 2002 until the 2006-2007 season. CBS moved it to Sunday nights for one season, before moving it back to its regular Thursday slot for season six. The program now airs in its new timeslot of Tuesdays at 10 P.M. Viewers can catch the seventh season of the program in this timeslot beginning September 23, 2008. Repeats of [i]Without a Trace[/i] also air regularly on TNT.

859,Monk: Season 1,"July 12, 2002","Former police detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), whose photographic memory and amazing ability to piece together tiny clues made him a local legend, has suffered from intensified obsessive-compulsive disorder and a variety of phobias since the unsolved murder of his wife, Trudy, in 1997. Now on psychiatric leave from the San Francisco Police Department and working as a freelance detective/consultant on difficult cases, Monk hopes to convince his former boss, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), to allow him to return to the force. Stottlemeyer, who wavered between admiration for Monk and annoyance at his eccentricities during the first season, becomes more of a friend to Monk as the series develops, frequently calling him in to help, as much for Monk's benefit as for his own. However, he knows Monk's limitations as well as his strengths and still harbor doubts about the wisdom of allowing Monk to carry a gun or subdue a perpetrator. Stottlemeyer's second-in-command, Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), also develops both admiration and compassion for the man he once labeled ""the defective detective.""

Despite flaws and inadequacies all around, the three become an increasingly effective team, with additional help from Monk's personal assistant. From the double-episode pilot through the first half of season three, Monk was aided by his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). But in the tenth episode of the third season, Sharona was replaced by a new assistant, Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard). Like Sharona, a divorcee with a son named Benjy, Natalie is a single parent, a widow with a daughter named Julie (Emmy Clarke). Unlike Sharona, Natalie is not a nurse but a former bartender with a fresh perspective on ""Mr. Monk,"" as she still addresses her new boss.",75,8.4,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/monk/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/1/14ed101e26ae011fed010b83ae5648f3-98.jpg

886,The Practice: Season 1,"March 4, 1997","David E. Kelley's Emmy Award-winning legal drama, The Practice, had eight amazing seasons, with promising, provocative, issue-related stories, coupled with the writer's trademark humor.

Set in Boston, The Practice centers on a firm of passionate attorneys to whom every case is important and every client worth a fight to the end. Legal maneuvering is the firm's modus operandi, and they have it down to a science, making even the most questionable arguments convincing. And while they can't - and don't - win every trial, the pursuit of justice remains the priority until the final verdict is announced … and sometimes afterwards. Pursuing justice, however, often confronts them with serious ethical and moral issues of conscience. The end of last season saw Bobby Donnell quitting the firm and leaving Eugene Young (Steve Harris) in charge. In the final season, we find Eugene not only tackling his new role as head of the firm, but also the new dynamic with co-workers Ellenor Frutt (Camryn Manheim), a single mom known for her fervent commitment to clients and for refusing to take ""no"" for an answer; Jimmy Berluti (Michael Badalucco), a hard-working ""good guy"" with a winning record and unparalleled loyalty to the firm; and a budding relationship with Jamie Stringer (Jessica Capshaw), a young associate recently out of law school. In addition to returning cast members Manheim, Harris, Badalucco and Capshaw, in the final season,  Kelley injected the series with intriguing new characters, including acclaimed film actor James Spader, who will play Alan Shore, a complicated and ethically challenged lawyer, and Rhona Mitra, who will play Tara Wilson, a confident paralegal in her third year of law school who is also the firm's new tough-as-nails assistant.

The multiple Emmy Award-winning drama has also earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, a Peabody Award, a Viewers for Quality Television Award, an American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award and, most recently, a coveted Humanitas Award.

895,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Season 1,"January 3, 1993","When the Cardassian occupation of Bajor ended in 2369, the mining space-station Terok Nor was left abandoned, its systems  ripped out.  By invitation of the provisional Bajoran government, Starfleet stepped in to oversee the rebuilding and day-to-day operations of the newly christened Deep Space Nine.  Starfleet's position was a tentative one, many Bajorans suspicious and unwelcoming as a result of Cardassian oppression and brutality.  However the alliance held and soon DS9 was a center of travel and commerce thanks to a newly found stable wormhole, leading to the largely unexplored Gamma Quadrant.

Then after two years, the Dominion - a hierarchy of three separate species, the xenophobic Changelings, the diplomatic but shifty Vorta and genetically-bred soldiers, the Jem'Hadar - made their presence known.  Seeing these new travelers coming through the wormhole as a threat to their power base, they decided to bring their version of order to the Alpha Quadrant... by conquering it.

This drama is set in a south Florida plastic surgery center, McNamara-Troy, centering around the two doctors who own it. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) is having problems at home, trying to keep his family together, trying to patch up the rocky road him and his wife Julia (Joely Richardson) are experiencing. On the other hand, sex-craved Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) uses his charm to bring in potential female candidates and conducts shady business deals, often for the love of money. While Sean takes his job seriously, he often has to fix Christian's mistakes. During the first season, Sean and Christian got mixed up with Escobar Gallardo, a Colombian drug lord who forced the two to do free surgery whenever he wanted them to. Sean's marriage with Julia began to wear thin, and Sean had an affair with a patient named Megan O'Hara. Julia went back to school, but it was interrupted by a miscarriage of a child Sean and Julia were trying to have. Christian learned he is the father of a baby with a woman named Gina, who he met at Sexaholics Anonymous. When the baby was born, we learn that the baby is African-American, and therefore not his. Julia questions Matt's paternity.

The second season begins with Sean and Christian both turning 40, and Christian playing father for Wilbur, who Gina is letting him take care of, until Wilbur's real father fights him for custody. Sean and Julia are quite happy together again until Christian's loneliness after Wilbur was taken away from him causes her to reveal that Matt is really his son. The secret ripples and eventually Sean finds out, causing a separation between Sean and Julia. He and Christian find a way to stay friends. A serial rapist named the Carver has been raping victims around Miami, and slices their face, and Sean makes a commitment to fixing their faces. Ava, a life coach for Sean and Julia, forms a sexual relationship with Matt, which is doomed from the beginning due to a wide age gap and Ava's screwed up son Adrian.

941,Arli$$: Season 1,"August 10, 1996","It's tough being a professional athlete. Sure, there are big bucks. And big time glory. But there's also responsibility. Temptations. The media. Hangers on. More temptation. Diminishing skills. Lost endorsements. An uncertain future. Still more temptations. In the fast lane of pro sports, an athlete needs someone he can trust. He needs a friend. An adviser. A big brother. Today's sports superstar needs more than just an agent, he needs a super agent. He needs Arliss.

Characters:

Arliss Michaels: Arliss Michaels claims to be the ""working man's friend."" He is the super athlete's super-agent, wheeling and dealing in the higher echelons of the sports world--an arena filled with glamour, hypocrisy and money. Arliss Michaels, sports agent extraordinaire, is not above misbehaving as outrageously as his superstar clients in an effort to get what he wants when he wants it.

Rita Wu Rita is Arliss' no-nonsense Girl Friday, seven days a week. As Arliss once said, ""If there were a Franklin Day Planner event in the Olympics, Rita would take the gold."" Rita's the one you want in your boat, ready to pass out life preservers and give directions. With enormous appeal and sass, she is often the moral voice in the AMM chorus, although she does have a certain weakness for Latin golf clients. Kirby Carlisle Kirby is an ex-football star turned agent as well as Arliss' old college buddy and first client. Endearingly ineffective, partially productive and effectively destructive, Kirby has a fondness for gambling, women and other distractions. The junior partner at Arliss Michaels Management (AMM), Kirby best orchestrates a night on the town for restless, action-seeking clients. Stanley Babson On the surface, Stanley appears to be Arliss' buttoned-up, straight-laced, conservative chief financial officer. Beneath his perfect three-piece suit lurks a buttoned-up, straight-laced, conservative chief financial officer. Stanley works magic with AMM clients' financial portfolios, with only an occasional investment blunder in a bum racehorse or pyramid scheme.",74,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/arli/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/0/2db7a81b45f7e0d9b3e7827517a6fc5a-98.jpg

The second and third seasons, therefore, introduced more and more eccentric characters who were given essentially ""nothing"" to do, and original seriesa regulars Gil Bellows and Courtney Thorne-Smith both left to pursue other projects.Ally McBeal was revitalized in its fourth season with the addition of Robert Downey Jr. as the lead character's love interest, Larry Paul. However, Downey's personal problems and numerous arrests, eventually wore out Kelley's patience and he was dropped. Lisa Nicole Carson, who played Ally's roommate, also left at the end of the fourth season following a brief stint in an institution and admitted problems with substance abuse.Without Downey, the fifth season had floundered more than ever; bringing in Jon Bon Jovi as a love interest, and giving Ally a daughter played by Hayden Panettiere) hadn't helped. Lucy Liu's character was dropped to a recurring role, while James LeGros left. James Marsden and Julianne Nicholson were added to the cast, only to be dropped a few weeks later. David E. Kelley decided then to cancel the show instead of having FOX executives do it for him.Awards/Nominations:EMMY AWARDS:> 1998 - Nominated - Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series [David E.

This is definitely not easy because Jamie & Paul are both equally neurotic - but in totally different ways. Paul is a documentary filmmaker, he is charming and creative, but also extremely careful and analytic. Jaime works as a public relations consultant, and is more of a free spirit, but also has a number of discomforts. Jaime's sister Lisa Stemple (Anne Ramsay) often comes to visit them, just like their friends Mark Devanow (Richard Kind), his wife Fran (Leila Kenzle) and Paul's cousin Ira Buchman (John Pankow). But, they aren't the only ones dropping by the apartment - there are always all kinds of other characters like noisy neighbours, a funny dogwalker (Hank Azaria), family members and others.

With a big part of personal intimacy, which Paul Reiser, the head character and the creator of the show, compares to ""a ride home after a party, when a couple can finally tell each other what have they been thinking all night"", the 30-minute show searches for capricious moments of every couple. Their co-creator of the show, Danny Jacobson, adds that ""they wanted to set a mirror to marriage life and see how the world is behind  closed doors"".

Terrified, the aristocracy threatens to prosecute Caesar for war crimes as soon as he sets foot in Rome.

1120,The Real World: Season 4,"June 28, 1995","""This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped. Find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. The Real World...""

How many times have we heard those words? The Real World was the first reality show on tv, premiering in 1992. It is still on the air, about to air it's 21st season, set in Brooklyn. When The Real World was created, it created a new genre of television that years later would be copied by other networks and become almost an obsession around the world. MTV originally wanted to make a soap opera, but the costs were too high, so they thought ""what if we could get rid of writers, and scripts, and sets?"". That resulted on the first Real World, set in NY neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, where 7 people that had never met before had to live in a house together for some time.

As the years went by, The Real World slowly gained its shape and space. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, Paris, San Diego, Philadelphia, Austin, Key West, Denver, Sydney and now Hollywood...all these locations have hosted the show. Auditions to be a cast member today attract hundreds of thousands of people in hopes to be one of the strangers in the house. Living rent-free for 6 months in a very hip house with very interesting (and often annoying) roommates, and being on an internationally broadcast tv show is quite attractive to people in their late teens/early 20s.

How much of the show is actually true we'll never know. A lot of what we see on tv is edited to make it look like it all happened in a certain timeline. All the houses have cameras everywhere, and there's a clause in the contract of each housemate that says they're not allowed to go places where the cameras are not allowed in. And all the sounds are taped in a separate way, so, according to Melissa from New Orleans, a lot of times when they're talking and you can only see the back of their heads, the words you hear might not be the words they actually said at the time. Edited or not, none of the scenes aired on the show are acted. They all happened, without scripts.

Each cast member receives around $250 per week, plus their house expenses paid (not including food. That's why every time a parent comes over, they cook). Anything else they want, they have to pay for. Plus, they don't get to take any of all the cool stuff you see in the house.

Today, The Real World is shown in several countries, and local versions of the show have already been made. Loving it or hating it, you just know it's here. The Real World: the first and original reality show.",71,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-real-world/season-4,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/3/24d51f9f169c10e36fe775284dfde6a3-98.jpg

1139,Murphy Brown: Season 1,"November 14, 1988","Murphy Brown was created by Diane English. Murphy is the star reporter on a news magazine show called FYI. The show is based in Washington DC, which gives the FYI team more than enough material to work with. Murphy lives in a townhouse that she has been having repainted for the duration of the series, Eldin the painter may never finish the job, but Murphy doesn't seem to mind. Murphy owes her Betty Ford trip to Phil, he owns the local bar & restaurant where the staff and the rest of the political scene have lunch. Phil knows about everything going on in Washington. Jim Dial is the uptight senior anchor, a seasoned veteran, who accompanied Murphy on her trip to the Betty Ford Clinic. Frank is a single guy and constantly looking for a girlfriend, he is also Murphy's best friend. Corky is a former Miss America turned news person, she covers all the ""hard"" news. Miles is a young Harvard graduate, whose first ""real job"" out of school is as executive producer of FYI. 

Murphy has trouble keeping a secretary, in this guide the actors that play this small part has their appearance number placed after their names, take note of the increasing number after the character name of Secretary. Some secretaries had no dialog and did not get credited, others wound up on the cutting room floor, this accounts for holes in the numbering scheme. When Murphy became a new mother, she began to run through nannies the same way, they are also numbered after the character name of Nanny. After running through 6 of them, she makes the obvious choice for a nanny, Eldin, who prefers the term ""Big Guy."" It also takes Murphy four months to give the baby his name. 

After nine seasons in the newsroom, the series looked like it might take a different direction in the 10th season. Murphy may change careers and become a White House senior advisor. Amazing since in the past she had been banned from the White House press room on several occassions. True to form, when she does, it is only for a short time. When a commercial for the series aired during the 49th Annual Prime Time Emmy Awards, it seemed to indicate that Murphy's life would take a different turn. It certainly does when she faces her own mortality when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Murphy Brown has done well with the Prime Time Emmy Awards with nominations in many categories and numerous awards for Candice Bergen as ""Best Actress in a Comedy Series."" So many in fact that she declined the nomination for 1996, allowing Helen Hunt to get the Emmy that Candice thought she deserved a few years earlier.

1206,Ashes to Ashes: Season 1,"March 7, 2009","Welcome to the Ashes to Ashes guide at TV.com.

DI Alex Drake of the Metropolitan Police is taken hostage and shot, and wakes to find herself apparently thrown back in time to 1981. She quickly recognises DCI Gene Hunt and his team from detailed reports made by DCI Sam Tyler about his own trip to 1973.

Initially sceptical about the surreal nature of her new environment, Alex, a modern, no-nonsense woman, clashed regularly with her sexist colleagues but had to learn to adjust while she strove to find her way back to 2008. As time passed, Alex started to accept her situation, and wonder whether her life in the future had been the dream. Executive Producer Jane Featherstone described this spin-off from Life on Mars as ""a touch of Moonlighting teamed with a measure of Miami Vice."" The show aimed to build on the success of its award-winning predecessor, resurrecting Philip Glenister's ever-popular detective while taking the opportunity to wink at 1980s fashions and attitudes.

The show was a hit for the Fox Broadcasting Company network, and its main characters and slogans (e.g., ""The Truth Is Out There"", ""Trust No One"", ""I Want to Believe"") became pop culture touchstones. The X-Files is seen as a defining series of the 1990s, coinciding with the era's widespread mistrust of governments, interest in conspiracy theories and spirituality, and the belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life.

TV Guide called The X-Files the Second greatest cult television show and the 37th best television show of all time. In 2007, Time magazine included it on a list of the ""100 Best TV Shows of All Time."" In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it Classic Sci-fi and the fourth best TV show in the last 25 years.

This long running FOX drama lasted nine seasons and focused on the exploits of FBI Agents Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, John Doggett and Monica Reyes and their investigations into the paranormal. From genetic mutants and killer insects to a global conspiracy concerning the colonisation of Earth by an alien species, this mind-boggling, humourous and occasionally frightening series created by Chris Carter has been one of the world's most popular sci-fi/drama shows since its humble beginnings in 1993.

So sit back and enjoy the fascinating world of The X-Files.

The entire nine seasons of The X-Files are now available on DVD!

1260,Nip/Tuck: Season 1,"July 22, 2003","Nip/Tuck - A disturbingly perfect drama. Be aware that the show description below, synopses of episodes, and the forum are likely to contain spoilers.

This drama is set in a south Florida plastic surgery center, McNamara-Troy, centering around the two doctors who own it. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) is having problems at home, trying to keep his family together, trying to patch up the rocky road him and his wife Julia (Joely Richardson) are experiencing. On the other hand, sex-craved Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) uses his charm to bring in potential female candidates and conducts shady business deals, often for the love of money. While Sean takes his job seriously, he often has to fix Christian's mistakes. During the first season, Sean and Christian got mixed up with Escobar Gallardo, a Colombian drug lord who forced the two to do free surgery whenever he wanted them to. Sean's marriage with Julia began to wear thin, and Sean had an affair with a patient named Megan O'Hara. Julia went back to school, but it was interrupted by a miscarriage of a child Sean and Julia were trying to have. Christian learned he is the father of a baby with a woman named Gina, who he met at Sexaholics Anonymous. When the baby was born, we learn that the baby is African-American, and therefore not his. Julia questions Matt's paternity.

The second season begins with Sean and Christian both turning 40, and Christian playing father for Wilbur, who Gina is letting him take care of, until Wilbur's real father fights him for custody. Sean and Julia are quite happy together again until Christian's loneliness after Wilbur was taken away from him causes her to reveal that Matt is really his son. The secret ripples and eventually Sean finds out, causing a separation between Sean and Julia. He and Christian find a way to stay friends. A serial rapist named the Carver has been raping victims around Miami, and slices their face, and Sean makes a commitment to fixing their faces. Ava, a life coach for Sean and Julia, forms a sexual relationship with Matt, which is doomed from the beginning due to a wide age gap and Ava's screwed up son Adrian.

1262,The Real World: Season 3,"June 23, 1994","""This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped. Find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. The Real World...""

How many times have we heard those words? The Real World was the first reality show on tv, premiering in 1992. It is still on the air, about to air it's 21st season, set in Brooklyn. When The Real World was created, it created a new genre of television that years later would be copied by other networks and become almost an obsession around the world. MTV originally wanted to make a soap opera, but the costs were too high, so they thought ""what if we could get rid of writers, and scripts, and sets?"". That resulted on the first Real World, set in NY neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, where 7 people that had never met before had to live in a house together for some time.

As the years went by, The Real World slowly gained its shape and space. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, Paris, San Diego, Philadelphia, Austin, Key West, Denver, Sydney and now Hollywood...all these locations have hosted the show. Auditions to be a cast member today attract hundreds of thousands of people in hopes to be one of the strangers in the house. Living rent-free for 6 months in a very hip house with very interesting (and often annoying) roommates, and being on an internationally broadcast tv show is quite attractive to people in their late teens/early 20s.

How much of the show is actually true we'll never know. A lot of what we see on tv is edited to make it look like it all happened in a certain timeline. All the houses have cameras everywhere, and there's a clause in the contract of each housemate that says they're not allowed to go places where the cameras are not allowed in. And all the sounds are taped in a separate way, so, according to Melissa from New Orleans, a lot of times when they're talking and you can only see the back of their heads, the words you hear might not be the words they actually said at the time. Edited or not, none of the scenes aired on the show are acted. They all happened, without scripts.

Each cast member receives around $250 per week, plus their house expenses paid (not including food. That's why every time a parent comes over, they cook). Anything else they want, they have to pay for. Plus, they don't get to take any of all the cool stuff you see in the house.

Today, The Real World is shown in several countries, and local versions of the show have already been made. Loving it or hating it, you just know it's here. The Real World: the first and original reality show.",70,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-real-world/season-3,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/3/24d51f9f169c10e36fe775284dfde6a3-98.jpg

1303,The Fugitive: Season 1,"October 6, 2000","""Updating the classic 1960's action series The Fugitive (1963) with the thrills and high-tech style of the 1993 Oscar-winning hit movie, ""The Fugitive"" returns to television with the riveting tale of Dr. Richard Kimble (Tim Daly), an innocent man accused of murdering his beloved wife. Adrift in a sea of strangers in strange locations, Kimble, on the hunt for the one-armed man who actually committed the crime, desperately tries to avoid being captured by Lt. Philip Gerard (Mykelti Williamson, ""The New WKRP in Cincinnati""), who always seems to be only two steps behind. From week to week, Kimble searches city after city for the elusive killer whose capture would finally allow him to prove his innocence and return to his former life. In constant flight in his quest for justice, Kimble touches many lives, but the encounters are ended as suddenly as they have begun when the fugitive is forced to escape to yet another city."" - CBS press release.

CBS premiered the much-hyped new action series on its Friday night lineup, which included fellow action series ""Nash Bridges"" and newcomer ""CSI."" Many predicted the new version of ""The Fugitive"" would become one of CBS's greatest hits, but the show only earned decent ratings for its first episode (curiously, everybody thought ""CSI"" was too morbid and wouldn't live to see a pickup, and it turned out to be the big hit ""The Fugitive"" was supposed to be). From then on ratings fell to an underexpected average, and eventually CBS decided to revitalize its Thursday nights with ratings magnet ""CSI,"" bumping Dick Van Dyke's ""Diagnosis Murder"" to Fridays, where it took ""The Fugitive""'s old time slot. Even with a good lead-in the ratings didn't rise (the show aired opposite ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"" which at the time drew huge numbers, giving the show a push to death). At the end of the season, CBS decided to cancel the entire lineup. At least they had the decency to show the series finale - but not to tell the producers not to write in a cliffhanger.

Fast-paced and wildly comedic, the series confronts social and moral issues, while its characters continually stretch the boundaries of the law.

Back-to-back Emmy Award winners James Spader and William Shatner play Alan Shore and Denny Crane, unlikely kindred spirits among the brigade of high-priced litigators at Crane Poole & Schmidt. In addition, Shirley Schmidt (played by five-time Emmy winner Candice Bergen), a founding partner of the firm, continues to help bring order to the chaotic office. She keeps a vigilant eye on all, particularly on Denny Crane, with whom she shares a checkered past.

Continuing to keep the office staff in tow is no-nonsense senior partner Carl Sack (Emmy Award winner John Larroquette), yet another ex-boyfriend of Shirley's, who has a newfound respect for the quirky team. Added to the mix are Jerry Espenson (Emmy Award winner Christian Clemenson), Shore's friend and fellow lawyer who suffers from Aspergers syndrome; and Katie Lloyd (Tara Summers), a young associate who is proving that she can run with the big dogs in the Boston offices.

1338,CSI: Miami: Season 1,"September 23, 2002","CSI: Crime Scene Investigation took television by storm in 2000 with its innovative and cutting-edge updating of a standard series concept – in this case, the cop show. Suddenly, instead of simply whodunit, solving crimes was a matter of howdunit, and with what size shoe, and whether anyone left behind traces of evidence that the blue ALS light could pick up. Now that gritty approach to crime known as forensic science makes its way from Las Vegas to the streets of Florida in CSI: Miami. A whole new team of crime scene investigators is on hand to probe the seamy underside of what some refer to as Cuba North and others call Georgia South. Consider it a tropical blend of people, culture, nightlife and, of course, the occasional killing or two. Just as you do in Vegas, come for the crime, stick around for the clues. And there's always a clue.

The Team

Horatio Caine is the lead criminologist, sort of the Grissom of the spin-off. But he's got a dangerous edge and a ""blind allegiance to justice.""

He died on duty when he was shot in a jewelry store while investigating a murder. Eric Delko is a funny and lovable character, now working as a CSI, specializing in underwater recovery. Alexx Woods is a young coroner. Alexx has the education that has earned her the nickname ""knowologist,"" and she often challenges the other CSIs. She is known to talk to the victims. Calleigh Duquesne is the team's ballistics expert, sometimes known as the ""bullet girl."" Ryan Wolfe is the newest member of the team.

1370,American Dreams: Season 1,"September 29, 2002","This evocative drama, which won two Emmy Awards, is set against the memorable music, the cultural clashes, and the Vietnam war during the 1960s. The third-year drama depicts the American landscape -- as seen through the youthful Pryor family of Philadelphia as they brace for the cultural turbulence ahead that still resonates in this contemporary era. Seventeen-year-old Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow, “Guiding Light”) is shedding her “good girl” image as she and her outspoken best friend Roxanne (Vanessa Lengies, “Popular Mechanics for Kids”) continue to pursue their dreams of making a difference as they struggle through the transition from teenager to adult. While they continue to dance on Dick Clark’s locally produced “American Bandstand,” they find -- as seniors at East Catholic High School -- that the world around them is growing ever closer with issues of the war, racism, feminism, and even teen marriage and pregnancy. At the same time, Meg’s mother Helen (three-time Emmy nominee Gail O’Grady, “NYPD Blue”) continues to face the challenge of the era’s modern woman, working and holding the family together. The family’s patriarch, Jack Pryor (Tom Verica, “Providence”), braces himself for the sociological and economic changes as he prepares to run for city councilman, and JJ (Will Estes, “7th Heaven”), a U.S. Marine fighting in Vietnam, struggles to find his way home to his family and his ex-fiancee, Beth Mason (Rachel Boston, “The Andy Dick Show”), who is pregnant with their child. In addition, adolescent Will (Ethan Dampf, “Collateral Damage”) tries to fit in at school after successful polio surgery, and smarty-pants Patty (Sarah Ramos) tries to find a balance between her brilliant mind and social acceptance among her high school peers. African-American father Henry Walker (Jonathan Adams, “The American Embassy”) remains hopeful that his partnership in Jack Pryor’s electronics store is a sign of positive social changes to come. However, the politics of the time continue to show him that the needs of the black community are not being met.

1372,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit: Season 1,"September 20, 1999","""In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.""
This hard-hitting and emotional companion series from NBC's Law & Order franchise chronicles the life and crimes of the elite Special Victims Unit of the New York Police Department. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was created by Emmy Award-winning producer Dick Wolf. SVU celebrated its 200th episode in April 2008.
Although Law & Order: Special Victims Unit carries the brand name Law & Order, the newer program has established a strong unique identity and has proved itself as a hit in its own right. In the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 seasons, the series broke into the Top 20. Mariska Hargitay has won a Golden Globe and Emmy each for her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. It also garnered Emmy wins for guest-stars Amanda Plummer, Leslie Caron, and Cynthia Nixon. The past three seasons, SVU has been NBC's highest-rated drama. Additionally, the series' popularity was recognized with the People's Choice Awards, Image Awards, Satellite Awards, and the TV Guide Awards with nominations for Favorite New Series.
The drama follows Det. Elliot Stabler, a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all, and his partner, Olivia Benson, whose difficult past is the reason she joined the unit. Overseeing the team is Capt. Donald Cragen. Cragen's tough but supportive approach to the team's complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day. Also featured is Det. John Munch, a transfer from Baltimore's homicide unit, who brings his acerbic wit, conspiracy theories and street-honed investigative skills. Munch is partnered with Det. Odafin Tutuola, whose unique sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch. Assistant District Attorney Kim Greylek adds a legal component to the series through her efforts to bring closure to the intense investigations. Also aiding the detectives is forensic psychiatrist Dr. George Huang, whose insight into the minds of the accused often provides significant clues that lead to the resolution of a case, and M.E. Melinda Warner, who helps the detectives get the evidence they need from the bodies they find.

1408,Family Ties: Season 1,"September 22, 1982","Family Ties first aired in September of 1982 on NBC and was one of the first of a wave of family comedies that emerged in the 1980's.  With a rocky start in the ratings, Family Ties rose to number 2 after it was placed in the prized time-slot right after The Cosby Show and remained there from 1984 until 1987.

The series centered around the Keaton family, Steven and his wife Elyse, both flower children of the 1960's.  They had four children, Alex, Mallory, Jennifer and Andrew, who was born in 1985.

What was unique about Family Ties was that it blended family comedy with politics.  The 1960's flower children, Steven and Elyse clashed with the 1980's conservative, Alex.  The show, in a way, showed the changing values during the Reagan era.  Besides political views, Family Ties covered a number of controversial topics ranging from suicide to racism to drug dependency.

Skippy was a neighbor who had a never-ending crush on Mallory.  Ellen was Alex's first serious girlfriend.  After breaking up with her, he became seriously involved with Lauren, a psychology student and Nick Moore was Mallory's serious boyfriend.

Now, she's interrogating witnesses whose lives and circumstances have since changed, making use of today's new science and finding fresh clues to solve cases that were previously unsolvable, all of which appeals to this smart, driven detective. She's also prepared for the consequences: that her work will open up old wounds and may lead suspects to commit new crimes. When she hits a dead-end, Lilly seeks advice from her respected mentor, Lt. John Stillman (John Finn, Catch Me If You Can). Also on the team are Det. Scotty Valens (Danny Pino, The Shield), Rush's confident and strong-willed partner; Det. Will Jeffries (Thom Barry, The Fast and the Furious), who's been around long enough to serve as Lilly's link to the past; and Det. Nick Vera (Jeremy Ratchford, Angel Eyes), a tough cop who's considered the go-to guy for getting a confession. Lilly makes it her business to ensure that no victim is ever forgotten.

And at the Formans', KITTY (Debra Jo Rupp) has problems with no kids in the house, while RED (Kurtwood Smith) has problems because it still seems like there are always kids in the house.

1698,Titus: Season 1,"March 20, 2000","This half-hour comedy chronicles the hilarious world of Christopher Titus and his totally messed-up poor white trash family. Between his drunken father, his dimwitted brother, and his goody-goody best friend, it's amazing Titus is alive, let alone  engaged to a ""normal"" girl.

Titus adapted Christopher Titus' stand-up routine in a novel way: each episode is narrated by Titus from a black & white ""Neutral Space,"" from which he comments on the events as they unfold, punctuated by short, surreal flashbacks to his childhood and adolescence. The hilarious interplay between these three levels of narrative is sometimes amazingly complex and even contradictory, highlighting the exceedingly black nature of the show's humor. Alas, the Fox network lived up to its history of commissioning innovative television and then sabotaging it; the third and blackest season was made particularly incoherent by showing the sequences out of logical order.

Titus never made it to syndication, and is currently unavailable — a buried gem — until its release on DVD in September 2005.",64,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/titus/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/7/dae88cc13be335332550650c56c2168e-98.jpg
1699,The Real World: Season 1,"May 21, 1992","""This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped. Find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. The Real World...""

How many times have we heard those words? The Real World was the first reality show on tv, premiering in 1992. It is still on the air, about to air it's 21st season, set in Brooklyn. When The Real World was created, it created a new genre of television that years later would be copied by other networks and become almost an obsession around the world. MTV originally wanted to make a soap opera, but the costs were too high, so they thought ""what if we could get rid of writers, and scripts, and sets?"". That resulted on the first Real World, set in NY neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, where 7 people that had never met before had to live in a house together for some time.

As the years went by, The Real World slowly gained its shape and space. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, Paris, San Diego, Philadelphia, Austin, Key West, Denver, Sydney and now Hollywood...all these locations have hosted the show. Auditions to be a cast member today attract hundreds of thousands of people in hopes to be one of the strangers in the house. Living rent-free for 6 months in a very hip house with very interesting (and often annoying) roommates, and being on an internationally broadcast tv show is quite attractive to people in their late teens/early 20s.

How much of the show is actually true we'll never know. A lot of what we see on tv is edited to make it look like it all happened in a certain timeline. All the houses have cameras everywhere, and there's a clause in the contract of each housemate that says they're not allowed to go places where the cameras are not allowed in. And all the sounds are taped in a separate way, so, according to Melissa from New Orleans, a lot of times when they're talking and you can only see the back of their heads, the words you hear might not be the words they actually said at the time. Edited or not, none of the scenes aired on the show are acted. They all happened, without scripts.

Each cast member receives around $250 per week, plus their house expenses paid (not including food. That's why every time a parent comes over, they cook). Anything else they want, they have to pay for. Plus, they don't get to take any of all the cool stuff you see in the house.

Today, The Real World is shown in several countries, and local versions of the show have already been made. Loving it or hating it, you just know it's here. The Real World: the first and original reality show.",64,tbd,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-real-world/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/3/24d51f9f169c10e36fe775284dfde6a3-98.jpg

•The ""Tool Time"" audience is ""Home Improvement""'s actual live studio audience.

•While taping some episodes of Tool Time, Tim sometimes asks an unseen character Klaus to play music for Tool Time segments. Klaus Landsberg worked in the sound department on ""Home Improvement"".

•Colleges and universities in Michigan sent star 'Allen, Tim' sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did.

•The name Binford Tools, the company that sponsor's the Tool Time show, is named after an anthropologist who made several new discoveries regarding stone age and tools.

•There is a running gag regarding the Taylor's neighbor, Wilson; his face is always concealed from about the nose down. In most episodes, Wilson was being shot from behind a fence, but in later episodes where he got out more often, camera shots, actor movements, and prop placements were carefully orchestrated so that his full face was not revealed. In fact, during all the curtain calls for the show (except the series finale curtain call, where his entire face was shown), actor Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, would bring a miniature picket fence to hold in front of his face so that it would remain hidden from view.

•The character Wilson is based on Tim Allen's childhood memories where he was too short to see over a fence, and was therefore unable to see his neighbor.

•Originally, actress Frances Fisher was cast as Jill Taylor but was replaced with Patricia Richardson 4 days before the pilot episode was taped.

•Richard Karn's wife, Tudi Roche, would occasionally make appearances on the show as Jill's sister Carrie.

•The full names of the older two Taylor boys were Bradley Michael Taylor and Randall William Taylor. (Mark's full name isn't mentioned during the series.)

•The label ""WLS"" was frequently used to cover up real corporate logos. WLS is the Chicago affiliate of ABC.

•While meeting with Bud Harper, Tim is told ""...Heidi tested better than Santa Claus."" Tim Allen played Santa Claus in Santa Clause, The (1994).

•As a running gag, whenever Tim enters the basement, he always bangs his head on a large pipe hanging overhead.

•The character 'Tim Taylor' was ranked #20 in TV Guide's list of the ""50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time"" (20 June 2004 issue).

1784,Firefly: Season 1,"September 20, 2002","""Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand. I don't care I'm still free, you can't take the sky from me. Take me out to the black, tell them I ain't coming back. Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me......There's no place I can be since I found Serenity, you can't take the sky from me.""

Firefly is set five hundred years from today in a new planetary system after humanity abandons ""Earth That Was"". Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds, a renegade who fought against the new unified central government (the ""Alliance""), the crew of the Firefly-class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can. They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar. This series was described as a ""science fiction western"" but is different from other space-based shows as it features no aliens.

(For stations and individuals seeking the intended air order of the series as specified by creator Joss Whedon, as opposed to the order Fox originally aired them or that they are informing stations is the order they should be shown in, see here)

Each of the crew members has a special role:

Malcolm Reynolds holds the duty of Captain - he is a defeated soldier who opposed the unification of the planets by the Alliance to no avail. He strives to keep all his crew members on task and Serenity flying safely, while trying to make a living and do the right thing...in his rather flexible moral framework.
Zoe (aka The Soldier) is extremely loyal to Reynolds as she served with him during the war and owes her life to him. Zoe has the strength and experience to take command of the ship, if necessary.
Wash is Serenity's pilot (and Zoe's husband) - unassuming, self-deprecating, and calm with a sense of humor.  Kaylee is the ship's mechanic - an experienced engineer who keeps Serenity flying.
Inara is a 'Registered Companion,' most easily described as a high-priced courtesan or geisha.  She is also the person with the highest social standing on the ship and acts as the crew's  Ambassador.
Jayne is the muscle of the crew.  A tough, uncultured Mercenary, unpleasant and offensively direct, but loyal to those on his crew...usually.

The newcomers are:

Simon Tam is the Doctor on Serenity and comes from a wealthy family and has a privileged upbringing. He has spent his life savings and future to save his sister, River.
River (aka The Fugitive) was experimented on by the government. Her psychic visions (a result of the experiments) are taken at first as babble by the crew but they slowly come to realize that there's more going on than what shows on the surface.
Book or ""The Shepherd,"" is a wise minister who knows far more about military matters and battle tactics than a man of the cloth should, and his past is shrouded in mystery.",63,8.3,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/firefly/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/1/f30c38da08a0c76638c45b62ff8381a3-98.jpg

Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true.

2223,The New Celebrity Apprentice: Season 1,"January 8, 2004","The Apprentice is the ultimate job interview, where sixteen Americans (eighteen in seasons two through six, fourteen in seasons seven and nine) compete in a series of rigorous business tasks, many of which include prominent Fortune 500 companies and require street smarts and intelligence to conquer, in order to show Donald Trump, the boss, that they are the best candidate for his companies.  In each episode, the losing team is sent to the boardroom, where Trump and his associates, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross, and later, his children, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump, judge the job applicants on their performance in the task.  One person is fired and sent home.  Who will succeed?  Who will fail?  And who will be The Apprentice?

The ninth season of The Apprentice is the third celebrity edition.  Fourteen celebrities will compete for the title of the third Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of the choice.  The season is already rife with big personalities and lots of drama, and though it's early, many tough competitors have emerged.

The eighth season of The Apprentice was yet another celebrity edition.  Sixteen celebrities competed for the title of the second Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of their choice.  The cast was more interesting than the previous batch of celebrities, and the drama was a lot more intense.  However, Trump started making less credible decisions in his firings, and the episodes were soon more about the drama among the celebrities than it was about the actual tasks.  In the end, comedienne Joan Rivers faced off against professional poker player Annie Duke in the show's second all-female final two, and despite the majority opinion that Duke's performance throughout the season had been better overall, Trump ended the season on a sour note with the controversial decision to name Rivers as the second Celebrity Apprentice.

The seventh season of The Apprentice saw the show returning to New York City.  And this time, instead of real people being the candidates, celebrities were.  Fourteen celebrities vied for the title of the first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, including a returning Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth from the first season.  Among the changes were both teams facing the boardroom following the task to hear what each team did right and wrong, in case that team ended up in the boardroom.  The season certainly wasn't without its share of drama, and it showed some pretty smart celebrity candidates.  In the end, America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan and country singer Trace Adkins faced off in the final two, and Morgan took the title of first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, taking $250,000 for the charity of his choice along with him.

The sixth season of The Apprentice saw the show leave New York City and move to an all-new location: Los Angeles, California!  Here, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross were gone and replaced as viceroys by Donald Trump's children, Donald, Jr., and Ivanka.  While the candidates, among whom were the show's first Asian-American man, the first Jamaican woman, a cervical cancer survivor, and not one, but two openly gay men, were interesting, the season pulled the show's lowest ratings ever, with too much focus on Trump and his brands, as well as Los Angeles pop culture, and not enough on the candidates and the tasks.  Also, Trump's logic behind his firing decisions made less and less sense.  In the end, Stefani Schaeffer, James Sun, Nicole D'Ambrosio, and Frank Lombardi all faced off in the show's first-ever final four finale that saw Stefani and James ending up as the final two, and Stefani walking away as the sixth Apprentice (and the second female Apprentice, to boot).

The fifth season of The Apprentice started with something new: the first Project Managers were chosen by Trump, and they got to pick their own teams.  Also, exemptions were wiped clean from the rules.  The season started out with promise, with four international candidates from Canada, Cuba, Great Britain, and Russia, but lost steam as the more interesting, colorful candidates, including three of the four international ones, quickly bit the dust and were fired earlier than the blander, less interesting ones.  The show ended up with what's been considered to be its worst final two ever, and in the end, the final international candidate, Sean Yazbeck, claimed victory over Lee Bienstock, the youngest candidate to ever make it to the final two, and won the title of the fifth Apprentice, as well as the honor of being the first winner to not be a native-born American.

The fourth season of The Apprentice returned to the basics -- the same men vs. women format and winning Project Managers winning exemption -- but this time, with a twist.  The winning Project Managers would only receive exemption from Trump if the team cast a majority vote to okay it.  The season, which featured the first-ever openly gay contestant and first-ever Russian immigrant, easily shaped up to be one of the best seasons of the show, with an interesting cast, exciting tasks, and even the show's first-ever quadruple-firing!  In the end, Dr. Randal Pinkett faced off with Rebecca Jarvis in the final two and won his rightful title as the fourth Apprentice and the first African-American winner.  However, the finale was marred by his refusing Trump's offer to hire Rebecca, as well, in what would've been the show's first double-hiring.

The third season of The Apprentice included a new twist: there are already two preset teams, ""Book Smarts"" and ""Street Smarts"" (Magna Corporation and Net Worth Corporation, respectively). They went head-to-head to see which team was smarter. In the end, the question was answered in the showdown of the century -- Kendra Todd, a college graduate, faced off against Tana Goertz, a high school graduate, in the show's first all-female final two.  While in the end, the Book Smarts won the battle, as Kendra was given the grand prize and the title of the third Apprentice (and the first female Apprentice, to boot), the experiment of season three showed that both groups of people can be very successful.

The second season of The Apprentice pitted men and women against each other again, but with several changes.  The winning Project Manager, or team leader, received an exemption the next week should his or her team lose the task.  The tasks became tougher, the judging became harder, and the contestants became fiercer.  By the end of the season, Kelly Perdew, though met with tough competition by Jennifer Massey, took his place with Trump on the other side of the boardroom table as the second Apprentice.

The first, and now classic, season of The Apprentice asked the age-old question: which gender is smarter?  Packed with memorable contestants and mesmerizing moments, the first season was an enormous hit, garnering some of NBC's best ratings in years.  By season's end, Bill Rancic was told, ""You're hired!"" and named the first and original Apprentice over Kwame Jackson, and all of the cast members became instant celebrities, with Donald Trump, as always, at the head of the pack.

of Days, The Usual Suspects) comes to television in a new comedy from Golden Globe Award-winning writer Cindy Chupack (Sex and the City), which examines the lives of three generations of men making their way through the dating world.""

""Byrne stars as Benjamin Madigan, a handsome, successful and charismatic architect in New York City. He is single, adorable and available and should be making out like a bandit with the ladies. But Benjamin is recently divorced, and after 20 years of being a dutiful husband and provider, he just hasn't got a clue about dating. He is a member of a rare breed of men -- the sexy man completely oblivious to his own sexiness. While his co-workers shove him into the dating world, he is full of the most rudimentary questions, like how soon to call a woman after she gives you her number. For the answers to these and many other questions, Ben can turn to his 16-year-old son, Luke (John Hensley), for whom juggling a series of girlfriends couldn't come more naturally. In addition, Ben's recently widowed father, Seamus (Roy Dotrice, TV's Beauty and the Beast), has just moved in. Seamus is ornery and speaks his mind, and with Luke's help, they might just be able to teach Benjamin a thing or two about dating and women in the 21st century."" (ABC press release)

""You took me by the hand
You made me understand
You taught me who I am

A bless and not a curse
But just a father's verse
To tell you that you're first
To tell you that you're mad""

2340,Law & Order: Criminal Intent: Season 1,"September 30, 2001","""In New York City's war on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad. These are their stories.""

Groundbreaking producer Dick Wolf presides over his popular, Emmy Award-winning Law & Order franchise with Law & Order: Criminal Intent, broadcast on NBC during its first six seasons and then moved to NBC Universal sibling USA Network beginning with season seven. This legal crime drama is unique among the other franchise programs in that it offers an additional dimension by exposing major crimes from the criminal's perspective. Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Det. Robert Goren, an exceptionally bright homicide investigator with well-honed instincts that match up favorably with his criminal quarry. Likewise, his partner, Det. Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe), brings an independence and stylish edge to her work that meshes well in tandem with Goren.

In the fifth season, they were joined by Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth), who had finally worked his way back from a ten-year exile to Staten Island.

Logan has worked with three partners. Carolyn Barak (Annabella Sciorra) was introduced in the fifth season as the meticulous and measured counterpart to the fiery Logan. Megan Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) joined major case in the sixth season as an equally brainy detective but with a bit of a wild side. Nola Falacci (Alicia Witt) worked with Logan for part of the seventh season while Wheeler was on another assignment (Nicholson's maternity leave). A hot-headed Irish-Italian mix, Falacci gave Logan a turn as the level-headed partner. Goren also worked briefly with another detective, G. Lyn Bishop (Samantha Buck), while Eames was on maternity leave (Erbe's real maternity leave).

Their commanding officer during the first five seasons, Capt. James Deakins (Jamey Sheridan), was a competent but ambitious political character who knew how to survive and thrive behind the scenes. All of them often butted heads with the no-nonsense Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver (Courtney B. Vance), a stickler for the crucial legal details for the first five seasons.

The sixth season introduced Eric Bogosian as Capt. Danny Ross to replace Jamey Sheridan. There was no replacement for the A.D.A. character.

René Balcer, a ten-year veteran of the original Law & Order series, developed Law & Order: Criminal Intent and served as head writer, executive producer and showrunner for the first five seasons. Warren Leight took over as showrunner and executive producer in seasons six and seven. Peter Jankowski and Norberto Barba are also executive producers.",54,8.5,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/law-order-criminal-intent/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/8/952b708c9281d95cf47b38a4d37721e6-98.jpg

2347,The District: Season 1,"October 7, 2000","A drama inspired by the real-life experiences of former New York Deputy Police Commissioner Jack Maple, The District revolves around Jack Mannion (Craig T. Nelson), a tenacious champion of the underdog and an avowed crime-fighter, whose revolutionary tactics have resulted in a 50-percent drop in crime, first in Boston, then in Newark, N.J. His latest challenge is Washington, D.C., which, despite being home to more law enforcement agencies than any other city on the planet, is riddled with crime and has a local police department that is demoralized and ineffective. Appointed Chief of Police by the mayor, Mannion works closely at Police Headquarters with Deputy Chief Joe Noland (Roger Aaron Brown). In his quest to ""make crime a thing of the past,"" Mannion has recruited Temple Page (Sean Patrick Thomas), a young detective on the force who is Mannion's eyes and ears on the most crime-ridden, drug-infested streets in America. Nancy Parras (Elizabeth Marvel), an intuitive officer, rounds out the chief's inner circle. Kevin Debreno Jonathan LaPaglia, the newest member of Mannion's unit, continues to challenge himself and his partner, Temple, at every turn. Together, Mannion and his team form a modern-day ""Untouchables,"" determined to make the District livable for all its citizens. The District premiered in October 2000 and was the most watched show on Saturday nights until May 2004, often managing to reach the top 20 in its first season. Unfortunately the show has suffered many losses in its short history, including creator Jack Maple and actress Lynne Thigpen.

In May 2004, CBS decided to scrap their Saturday lineup, cancelling fellow Saturday show Hack. The District lasted 4 successful seasons.

2401,Clueless: Season 1,"September 20, 1996","Based on the 1995 hit film of the same name, Clueless is a popular half-hour American sitcom. The show aired for three seasons between 1996 and 1999. Clueless began life as part of ABC's popular 'TGIF' strand, but after it had finished it's first run, the network decided to cancel the series. It was a decision they would later regret, when it's re-runs proved a huge ratings winner, even competing with the incredibly successful Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Rival network UPN promptly capitalized on ABC's mistake, and the series found a new home where it aired for two further seasons. In a change to the movie, Rachel Blanchard plays the well natured and complicated, yet, as the shows title suggests, clueless teen soul Cher Horowitz. But many of the movie's cast return to reprise their characters, including Stacey Dash as Cher's sexy, confident and sassy friend Dionne Davenport. Set in the wealthiest parts of Beverley Hills, the show profiled the many loves and lives of Cher and her friends, all equally as rich, pretty and charming as her - all, that is, but the rude and self obsessed Amber Mariens (Elisa Donovan). Without her mother around, young Cher must travel through the trickiest times - those oh-so awkward teenage years - with the guidance of only her friends and father (Michael Lerner, Doug Sheehan). Joining her on her journey, are Murray Duvall (Donald Adeosun Faison) and Sean Holliday  (Sean Holland) who more often than not, find themselves getting into trouble, not doing enough to help or generally just getting it very wrong. As the show developed, and the character's developed, the writing changed. From the relaxed, confident and slow pace of the first season, to the quick, sassy, off-the-cusp and celebrity-reference filled style of the second and third seasons, enter to a new and faster style of editing for the final two seasons with some hillariously well-timed sound effects and musical scores that complimented the jokes with style. Despite all it's good points, Clueless fell victim to the UPN axe and was cancelled in 1999. But the show has now gone into syndication across the world to a brilliant response, most notably from the United Kingdom and the USA. Clueless - one of the late great teen-orientated sitcoms of the '90s.

In order to blend in, they have assumed human form. This is the High Commander [Dick]. He has assembled an elite team of experts: A decorated military officer [Sally], a seasoned intelligence specialist [Tommy] and [Harry], well, they had an extra seat.""3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN is an inspired half-hour comedy series farcically dealing with the human condition set in the fictional city of Rutherford, Ohio. This gentle-hearted series stars John Lithgow as the High Commander of an investigative team sent to Earth on a mission to learn everything about humans and their so-called advanced civilization. Described by its producers as ""Carl Sagan meets the Marx Brothers,"" 3RD ROCK has a clever, distinct point of view seen through the extraterrestrial team who has no other worldly powers except absolute truthfulness.  Dick (John Lithgow, Don Quixote), Harry (French Stewart, Love Stinks), Sally (Kristen Johnston, Austin Powers) And Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 10 thing I Hate About You), arrive in our world completely innocent, while equipped with superior intelligence to analyze every experience. This bizarre vantage point of an innocent seeing everything for the first time is the comic framework from which to satire the human condition and American society, to look at all of the injustices and absurdities and humorously point them out to us.  3RD ROCK cuts through our taboos and traditions with a childlike inquisitive logic and an impeccably paced humorous twist. We the viewers see ourselves in 3RD ROCK, and we see ourselves as the aliens.The humor of 3RD ROCK is always twisting the viewpoint to show the angle of an outsider looking in. 3RD ROCK which we know as Earth is the way travellers would look at the world - an insignificant blue speck that is The 3rd Rock from the Sun.Reruns were last seen on ABC Family on April 15, 2005 at 9:00am ET with the episode ""The Big Giant Head Returns Again, Part 1"" and may return at some other time.

2488,Greetings from Tucson: Season 1,"September 27, 2002","In this autobiographical family comedy, based on the life of series creator Peter Murrieta, life is seen through the eyes of 15-year-old David Tiant (Pablo Santos) as he faces the challenges of growing up in an ethnically mixed, upwardly mobile family.

David's dad Joaquin (Julio Oscar Mechoso, ""High Incident"", ""Damon"") is a proud yet infuriatingly pragmatic Mexican-American.  Joaquin's world is built on old-fashioned values of working hard to get ahead, taking care of your family and - the one that causes the most trouble - father knows best.  His wife, Elizabeth (Rebecca Creskoff, ""Quintuplets"") is an Irish-American who is fiercely proud of her husband and family.  David's cheerleading diva of an older sister, Maria (Aimee Garcia, ""All About the Andersons""), is having a little identity crisis of her own, rejecting her Mexican roots and telling people that the family is Spanish.  Also living with the family is David's irreverent Uncle Ernesto (Jacob Vargas) who is gainfully employed as an animal control officer, yet tends to drift good-naturedly through life, having acquired three ex-wives and a young son named Daniel (Bobby Chavez) along the way.  Little Daniel looks up to his cousin David and is in constant awe of his relatives' new status as members of the middle class.

The matriarch of the family is David's free-spirited grandmother, Magdalena (Lupe Ontiveros), who is determined to escape the old folks' home, where her only entertainment is breaking every rule, and move in with her beloved grandchildren.  Knowing that his mother will cause as much trouble as his teenage children do, Joaquin has been fighting this move every step of the way. 

Joaquin's recent promotion has enabled the family to move to a bigger house in a nice Tucson neighborhood, and David is pleasantly surprised when his new next-door-neighbor, Sarah (Sara Paxton), turns out to be not only a very pretty girl, but a potential best friend. 
At the center of this chaotic family circle is the relationship between Joaquin and David, whose mixed heritage only adds to the eternal adolescent dilemma of exactly how - and if - he fits in.  Though he is secretly proud of his son, Joaquin rarely shows it, and his first impulse is always to criticize rather than praise.  Not really appreciating how bright David is, Joaquin is convinced that without his constant advice, his son is headed for disaster.  As with most father-son relationships, the truth is that they have a lot to learn from each other.

2510,Boy Meets World: Season 1,"September 24, 1993","This gentle yet mildly surreal sitcom was part of ABC's ""TGIF"" lineup aimed at pre-teens and early teens. Its tenure lasted from 1993 through its end in 2000. The people in the world of teenager Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) continue to test his theories about life and relationships, on the fourth season of ""Boy Meets World."" 
Topanga (Danielle Fishel) is one person who continues to test Cory's outlook and emotions in the ways of young love. Though they are back together again after a bumpy start, anything could happen when it comes to their relationship. 
His best friend, Shawn (Rider Strong), no longer lives with English teacher Jonathan Turner ( Anthony Tyler Quinn), but with his truck-driver dad, who has moved back to town. Cory, who was instrumental in bringing the father and son together, hopes that Shawn's mother will also rejoin the family. 
Cory's older brother, Eric (Will Friedle), failed to get accepted to a four-year college, even after all of his amusing yet sincere efforts to do so. He must now figure out if he's either going to make a fresh start living out of town or stay within the comforts of home.

Eric isn't the only one trying to decide what's best for his life. Their dad (William Russ) is also at a point where he must decide his future. He's worked at the grocery store since his teenage years and wonders if it isn't time to explore a different career.  Fortunately, there's always Cory's mom, Amy (Betsy Randle), to give everyone guidance and all sorts of helpful advice; and his little sister, Morgan (Lindsay Ridgeway), to add her ten-year-old point of view. 
At high school, the ever-present and wise Principal George Feeny (William Daniels) continues to make Cory's and Shawn's lives more challenging. The principal even gets involved with former student Eric as he makes some educational decisions. Feeny, who still lives next door to the Matthews, has a unique way of always seeming to know what unpredictable antics the young men are up to.

Now she takes us into the lives of her friends, family and neighbors... Her circle of girlfriends on Wisteria Lane includes Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), a known klutz who recently remarried the love of her life; Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), who struggles with her family and career; Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross), the owner of a thriving catering business and a successful cookbook author, whose lovelife is very complicated nowadays; the ex-model turned housewife Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria Parker), who finds herself chasing after two daughters plus a wild niece. The ladies have welcomed the now single Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), who lived on the street once before when Mary Alice was alive, into their small, tight-knit group, and the newest housewife to arrive on the lane, Angie Bolen (Drea de Matteo), promises to shake things up quite a bit.Then there are the men: Mike Delfino (James Denton), Susan's husband, a charming plumber; Lynette's adorable husband, Tom (Doug Savant), who always stays by his wife's side despite many challenges; Gabrielle's husband, Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), who works hard to provide for his wife and daughters; Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a devoted husband to Bree; and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling), Angie's creepy and secretive husband.

2637,Family Matters: Season 1,"September 22, 1989","A perfect spin-off from Perfect Strangers: Family Matters focused on Harriet Winslow (the elevator operator from the Chronicle) and her family of sorts. Carl Winslow, her husband, was a dutiful cop, and a gruff and lovable father to three kids: Eddie Winslow, the rebel son; Laura Winslow, the smart-aleck daughter; and cute little Judy Winslow. They had opened their home to Harriet's sister, Rachel Crawford and her little baby son Richie, and in the very first episode, Carl had to open his home to his cool and streetwise mother, Estelle Winslow, whether he wanted to or not. Everything was going along just fine until one day, Steve Urkel, the inventive nerd, barged into their home and eventually, into their hearts. Steve had a killer crush on Laura, but she would never give him the time of day. Steve Urkel was intended to be a one-shot appearance, but his popularity with the fans won him the number-one spot as America's favorite nerd.As the show went on, the characters and the stories evolved. Richie grew from a little baby into a rambunctious and impressionable little boy. The stories started revolving around Steve and his incredible inventions, which became the greatest sight gags on the show. In almost every episode, Steve ends up breaking furniture, windows, and Carl's patience. Eddie and Laura each had best buddies to hang out with: Eddie had dim-witted yet lovable Waldo Geraldo Faldo,and Laura had faithful and true-blue gal pal Maxine. The greatest mystery of Family Matters is Judy and Rachel's sudden disappearances from the show, but Rachel made guest appearances whenever possible.To stop Steve from chasing her, Laura matched him up with perky-yet-pushy Myra Monkhouse. Steve loved Myra physically, but his emotions will always go to Laura.  Eddie had his share of steady girlfriends, and even he had an Urkel chasing him- Myrtle May Urkel, Steve's cousin from Biloxi (Jaleel White also). Every so often, Steve uses one of his inventions to turn himself into debonair, irresistable lover Stefan Urquelle or karate hero Bruce Lee to draw Laura closer to him, much to Myra's chagrin.At the end of season 6, the Winslows welcomed Steve into their home when Steve's family went to Russia. Pretty soon, Richie hung out with 3J, a tough, streetwise kid always running from the children's home. The Winslows then adopted 3J as one of their kids, as they did with Steve.In the final season, Family Matters - along with Step by Step - moved to CBS, and Steve slowly matured from the annoying nerd that he used to be. This was when Laura started falling in love with Steve, and Myra got kicked to the curb, but she vowed to get her ""Stevie-kins"" back. Also, the original Harriette, JoMarie Peyton, had left the show in mid-season and Judyann Elder took her role. Steve and Laura got engaged, but they never had a wedding because CBS dropped the ax on the show. But, nevertheless, Family Matters had a great successful run and is one of the longest running African-American comedies ever.

2701,Clerks: Season 1,"December 14, 2002","This animated series, based on Kevin Smith's 1994 film of the same name, centers on Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, the clerks at The Quick Stop and RST Video. These ""slackers"" spend most of their time spoofing pop culture and whining about their miserable lives. Adding color to their lives are the resident ""hetero-life partners"" Jay and Silent Bob, who hang out and sell fireworks outside the store. Every show needs an evil villain, so to accommodate, Leonardo Leonardo was created -- a rich, gay psychopath, who was the evil foil for our heroes. Leonardo's sidekick, the menacing Plug, was a robot. NBA player Charles Barkley voiced himself in nearly every episode, playing the nemesis of Jay and Silent Bob. And Lando was created in episode 3 to address the lack of black characters in the show.  Utilizing the animation, the makers inserted tons of film and television spoofs, and cameos from many stars.This short lived series not only set a record for the length of time it spent on the air, but for the length of the titles as well! The show was green lighted by ABC for six episodes, but the release date kept getting pushed back and after a spot on the Superbowl, they finally got around to airing the series on May 31, 2000. After playing the show for two weeks, the series was abruptly jerked off the air, even though the additional four episodes were scheduled. Plans were made to cut the episodes into a feature film, but this idea was eventually scrapped and all six episodes appeared on video and DVD the following year. Also worth noting, Leonardo Leonardo was based on (and originally voiced by) Alan Rickman (Dogma, Die Hard, Galaxy Quest), but the execs at ABC didn't want Rickman, so Alec Baldwin stepped in to do the voice.On the video version, the real Jay and Silent Bob come out to introduce each episode (and there's a special appearance by Randal). On the DVD, these clips appear after an animated version of Jay and Silent Bob holding up a card with the episode number. The DVD also includes an audio commentary, two featurettes, animatics, the Superbowl spot, and a long promo made for a film/comic convention. As a DVD-ROM bonus, there are script/storyboards and character profiles.On December 22, 2002, all six episodes premiered in a marathon on Comedy Central. Since then, the series has aired from time to time on Comedy Central, mostly during late night with the cable channel's other animated programming.",47,7.0,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/clerks/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/4/7c9e38500d82c6f2da2f98db43879d38-98.jpg

Each of these chefs dreams of fame and fortune, but many soon find their dreams becoming nightmares. Chef Ramsay demands quality and the intensity of the challenges is beyond anything the contestants can ever imagine. Split into two teams, they must compete against each other to provide their very best in the kitchen. If they do, they are lavishly rewarded with everything from extravagant trips to a ride on Ramsay's personal yacht. Those that fail are forced to suffer humiliating punishment.

At the end of each episode, the chef who provided the best performance in Ramsay's opinion on the losing team is chosen to select two chefs from their own team for elimination. They must then give their reasons for their selection. Though one of these two chefs may be eliminated, Ramsay is under no obligation to choose either, and the final decision as to who is sent home is made solely by him.

From Waffle House chefs to executive chefs, the competitors are tested in every way possible, from leadership skills to culinary skills. Traditional challenges include a taste-test of everyone's palette and special events such as birthdays and weddings. The chefs, however, must always be on their toes, as they never know when surprises may be coming.

And both boys are the son of former college ball player, Dan Scott, whose long ago choice to abandon Lucas and his mother Karen, will haunt him long into his life with wife Deb, and their son Nathan. Until now, Dan has managed to keep his two sons far from each other. But the past and present collide sharply when Tree Hill's basketball coach recruits Lucas for his team, much to the chagrin of Nathan and Daddy Dan. And the siblings natural rivalry only intensifies when they set their sights on the same girl, Peyton Sawyer. The residue of the past lingers far into the future for the residents of Tree Hill, even as a new generation is rising. Tree Hill follows the lives and loves of these two brothers, their friends and their family as they navigate high school, marriage, and finally... adulthood. One Tree Hill theme song:
I don't want to be by Gavin DeGraw

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately

2756,"Walker, Texas Ranger: Season 1","April 21, 1993","Cordell Walker is a contemporary Texas Ranger working out of the Dallas office who believed in dealing with criminals the old-fashioned way--by beating them up. Despite the rules that governed the way law-enforcement officers were supposed to act. Walker's approach closely resembled the ""eye for an eye"" school of crime fighting.

His partner is young Jimmy Trivette, who had grown up in the slums of Baltimore and used football as his ticket to a college education and a career with the Dallas Cowboys until he busted his shoulder. Despite Jimmy's belief in computers and scientific criminology, working with Walker, always seemed to leave him bruised and sore--when Walker was trying to get information or take people into custody it was more than likely there would be a fistfight or karate kicks. County Assistant D.A. Alex Cahill, his sometimes girlfriend, frowned on Walker's methods, even if they did get results.

When not on duty Walker and the others hung out at C.D.'s, the saloon/restaurant owned by his buddy C.D. Parker, a former Ranger forced into early retirement after taking a bullet in the knee, who still provided help and advice on cases. Uncle Ray was the wise old Native American who had raised Walker. He died at the end of the 3rd season.

Star Chuck Norris, former karate champion and movie star, played Walker in the deadpan unemotional style he used in most of his feature films. Nothing ever seemed to excite him, and the violence on the show had a cartoon quality about it. There was a surrealistic efficiency about Walker--he almost never broke sweat, got hurt, or wasted a blow--using violence because it was necessary but never glorying on it. This is Norris' first time in a TV series.",45,7.1,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/walker-texas-ranger/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/4/33338df09880e86d5f05ccbe92cc2ca2-98.jpg

2803,George Lopez: Season 1,"March 27, 2002","""George Lopez,"" the hit family comedy starring popular standup comedian George Lopez, is on ABC. The series is from Bruce Helford, Deborah Oppenheimer and Robert Borden – all from ABC's long-running hit comedy series, ""The Drew Carey Show"" – and actress/producer Sandra Bullock (""Miss Congeniality,"" ""Speed"").George Lopez is a guy who has made lemonade from lemons at every turn. Since he became plant manager at an L.A. airplane parts factory, he has handled a complicated and tumultuous job, a strong but challenging marriage, two rebellious children and a mother who can't keep track of her own lies about his childhood -- all with his sense of humor intact.His affable compadre, Ernie (Valente Rodriguez, ""Erin Brokovich""), still ribs George about his high-powered management position at the plant, but always lends a hand when George needs him. Ernie, who still lives with his mother and father, has learned some fathering skills of his own after foster-parenting a troubled twelve-year-old boy.Though their marriage has had some close calls, George and his devoted wife, Angie (Constance Marie), still chose to renew their vows recently. Angie deals with his questionable decisions and freewheeling approach to parenthood and his mother's insensitive wisecracks with the patience of a saint -- and some guidance from her father, Vic (Emiliano Díez) -- but her drive to build a still unprofitable wedding-planning business has nearly driven their family to the poor house. George's biggest test, both at work and home, is dealing with his tough and acerbic but loving mother, Benny (Belita Moreno, ""Perfect Strangers""), while sifting through her vast assortment of lies about his family and childhood. After rediscovering and losing his father to kidney disease and learning of a long lost sister, George constantly wonders what, or who, is around the next corner. After running away from home, being expelled from school and falling in love with a handsome jock, sixteen year-old Carmen's (Masiela Lusha) free-spirited, teenage rebellion has left her parents at a total loss about what to do next. Always the practical joker, thirteen-year-old Max clearly maintains the sense of humor he inherited from his father, but continues to struggle with dyslexia and constantly tests his parents' limits by being drawn toward the wrong crowd.",44,7.7,https://www.metacritic.com/tv/george-lopez/season-1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/tv/0/e23fd1691b36823404765e328bce33b7-98.jpg

3006,Big Brother: Season 2,"July 5, 2001","Big Brother, which began in the summer of 2000, has become an annual tradition for fans; every summer (with the exception of the 2008 winter edition) viewers are treated to new HouseGuests, new challenges, and new evictions!  Here's how the game works: each week, there is a Head of Household challenge, where all of the players compete for the power in the house.  The HoH then nominates two other HouseGuests for eviction.  Several days later, a Power of Veto competition is held, where six players (the HoH, the nominees, and three guests) attempt to win the Golden Power of Veto, which gives the bearer the power to ""veto,"" or cancel, one of the HoH's nominations, forcing the HoH to nominate someone else (other than the Veto bearer) for eviction.  Then, in the weekly live eviction, the HouseGuests vote to evict someone from the house for good.  Along the way are Food competitions  (which, if the HouseGuests do not win, results in them eating ""Slop"" for the week) and the occasional Luxury competition, all leading up to the show's finale, where a panel of sequestered jurors vote for a winner, who receives half a million dollars!

Big Brother 6: This season is the ""Summer of Secrets,"" with a brand new, state-of-the-art house, equipped with secret compartments and secret rooms.  Not only that, but each of the houseguest began their adventure with a secret: everyone is playing the game with a partner - someone they know from the outside world.  So far, the game has not ended yet, so all bets are off as to who will emerge from the Big Brother house victorious!  However, if a secret team should make it to the finals, the winner will receive $1,000,000, the biggest prize in BB history, and the runner-up will receive $250,000.   Big Brother 6 regular airings:

3036,Big Brother: Season 1,"July 5, 2000","Big Brother, which began in the summer of 2000, has become an annual tradition for fans; every summer (with the exception of the 2008 winter edition) viewers are treated to new HouseGuests, new challenges, and new evictions!  Here's how the game works: each week, there is a Head of Household challenge, where all of the players compete for the power in the house.  The HoH then nominates two other HouseGuests for eviction.  Several days later, a Power of Veto competition is held, where six players (the HoH, the nominees, and three guests) attempt to win the Golden Power of Veto, which gives the bearer the power to ""veto,"" or cancel, one of the HoH's nominations, forcing the HoH to nominate someone else (other than the Veto bearer) for eviction.  Then, in the weekly live eviction, the HouseGuests vote to evict someone from the house for good.  Along the way are Food competitions  (which, if the HouseGuests do not win, results in them eating ""Slop"" for the week) and the occasional Luxury competition, all leading up to the show's finale, where a panel of sequestered jurors vote for a winner, who receives half a million dollars!

Big Brother 6: This season is the ""Summer of Secrets,"" with a brand new, state-of-the-art house, equipped with secret compartments and secret rooms.  Not only that, but each of the houseguest began their adventure with a secret: everyone is playing the game with a partner - someone they know from the outside world.  So far, the game has not ended yet, so all bets are off as to who will emerge from the Big Brother house victorious!  However, if a secret team should make it to the finals, the winner will receive $1,000,000, the biggest prize in BB history, and the runner-up will receive $250,000.   Big Brother 6 regular airings:
